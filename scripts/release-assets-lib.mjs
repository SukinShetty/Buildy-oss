// release-assets-lib.mjs — replace a release's files IN PLACE, so its download
// links keep working throughout, and never change whether it is published.
//
// GitHub allows only one asset per name on a release, so "upload the new file
// and then remove the old one with the same name" is done as:
//   1. upload the new file as "<name>.uploading"     (old file still served)
//   2. rename the old file to "<name>.old"
//   3. rename the new file to "<name>"               (new file served)
//   4. delete "<name>.old"
// The link is unavailable only between 2 and 3 — two back-to-back API calls.
// If 3 fails, the old file is renamed back, so the link keeps the old file.
//
// The GitHub calls are injected (see release-assets.mjs), so the order is
// unit-tested (release-assets-lib.test.ts).
